# Introduction
This project delved into the Lightcast labor market dataset utilizing PySpark and Plotly, advancing from exploratory data analysis and visualization to sophisticated regression modeling and large-scale machine learning. Each lab emphasized the development of technical, analytical, and visual communication skills through structured objectives and the processing of real-world data workflows.

# Lab 01 — Visual Reporting and Storytelling

**Key Objectives:**  
• Successfully loaded and analyzed the Lightcast dataset within a Spark DataFrame.  
• Developed Plotly visualizations to examine:  
  ◦ Salary distributions  
  ◦ Employment trends  
  ◦ Job postings  
• Investigated the relationship between skills and NAICS/SOC/ONET codes concerning salaries.  
• Enhanced the readability and presentation of visualizations by customizing colors, fonts, and styles.  
• Implemented best practices for effective data communication.  
• Compiled and presented results in both Jupyter Notebook and HTML formats.

# Lab 02 — Insight from Data and Visualizations
**Key Objectives:**  
• Processed the Lightcast dataset using PySpark before converting it to Pandas for visualization purposes.  
• Created advanced scatter plots and histograms to analyze:  
  ◦ Education levels  
  ◦ Categories of remote work  
• Imputed missing salary data by using group medians for accuracy.  
• Visualized salary distributions based on:  
  ◦ Experience  
  ◦ Education  
  ◦ Remote setting  
• Provided clear written insights for each chart to elucidate key trends.

# Lab 03 — Regression Modeling on Employment Data
**Key Objectives:**  
• Conducted regression analysis on the Lightcast dataset utilizing PySpark.  
• Engineered predictive features derived from structured columns relevant to salary data.  
• Trained a Linear Regression model aimed at salary prediction.  
• Evaluated the model's performance using RMSE and R² metrics.  
• Created diagnostic plots to visualize predictions and assess model accuracy.

# Lab 04 — Machine Learning on Scale
**Key Objectives:**  
• Employed PySpark for the large-scale processing of the Lightcast dataset.  
• Engineered structured features suitable for salary prediction at scale.  
• Trained and validated a Linear Regression model using distributed data effectively.  
• Assessed model results using RMSE and R² metrics.  
• Developed diagnostic visualizations to evaluate predictive performance and identify model patterns.e and detect model patterns.
