Each lab emphasized the development of technical, analytical, and visual communication skills through structured objectives and the processing of real-world data workflows.\n\n# Lab 01 — Visual Reporting and Storytelling\n\n**Key Objectives:**  \n• Successfully loaded and analyzed the Lightcast dataset within a Spark DataFrame.  \n• Developed Plotly visualizations to examine:  \n  ◦ Salary distributions  \n  ◦ Employment trends  \n  ◦ Job postings  \n• Investigated the relationship between skills and NAICS/SOC/ONET codes concerning salaries.  \n• Enhanced the readability and presentation of visualizations by customizing colors, fonts, and styles.  \n• Implemented best practices for effective data communication.  \n• Compiled and presented results in both Jupyter Notebook and HTML formats.\n\n# Lab 02 — Insight from Data and Visualizations\n**Key Objectives:**  \n• Processed the Lightcast dataset using PySpark before converting it to Pandas for visualization purposes.  \n• Created advanced scatter plots and histograms to analyze:  \n  ◦ Education levels  \n  ◦ Categories of remote work  \n• Imputed missing salary data by using group medians for accuracy.  \n• Visualized salary distributions based on:  \n  ◦ Experience  \n  ◦ Education  \n  ◦ Remote setting  \n• Provided clear written insights for each chart to elucidate key trends.\n\n# Lab 03 — Regression Modeling on Employment Data\n**Key Objectives:**  \n• Conducted regression analysis on the Lightcast dataset utilizing PySpark.  \n• Engineered predictive features derived from structured columns relevant to salary data.  \n• Trained a Linear Regression model aimed at salary prediction.  \n• Evaluated the model's performance using RMSE and R² metrics.  \n• Created diagnostic plots to visualize predictions and assess model accuracy.\n\n# Lab 04 — Machine Learning on Scale\n**Key Objectives:**  \n• Employed PySpark for the large-scale processing of the Lightcast dataset.  \n• Engineered structured features suitable for salary prediction at scale.  \n• Trained and validated a Linear Regression model using distributed data effectively.  \n• Assessed model results using RMSE and R² metrics.  \n• Developed diagnostic visualizations to evaluate predictive performance and identify model patterns.e and detect model patterns.\n\n",
